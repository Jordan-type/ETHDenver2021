# ETH Denver 2021 - update of 2021-02-05
* initialise a github common repository - **done**
* initialise a TODO - **done**
* fill the TODO
* allocate the responsible and the peer backup persons for each task
* define a target date for each task
# Logistics
* Let's have a 30' progress call each day. Here is the When2meet to coordinate our large time zones and find a slot that suits everybody: [https://www.when2meet.com/?10945948-rY2Up](https://www.when2meet.com/?10945948-rY2Up)
* If you're not familiar with When2Meet, they have a Youtube tutorial in the menu "About" at the top left
# What we could do (proposition of storyboard)
This is a rough roadmap that we can use as basis to adapt and fill the TODO.

The plan would be to 
1. **port Pepito to Celo**: Duke Silver is fine with that, He's Celo, IPFS, Solidity, React, java
2. **have Pepito store on IPFS** its table of Disguise addresses. Any Solidity + IPFS person would do
3. have **each PepitoDisguise store on Textile or OrbitDB** its data. Here we need someone Solidity + React + IPFS/Textile/orbitDB
4. ... and/or **use Ceramic** to describe the data model **and IDX** for identity, but this might collide with Celo  
5. make the **Pepito frontend more sexy** and add a dialog to update the features of a PepitoDisguise and store again. Here someone React+IPFS/Textile/OrbitDB
6. Add a **mobile frontend using the Valora mobile** API of Celo (cherry over the cake, IMHO in 1 week we'll not have time
7. another cherry on the cake, **use TheGraph to query the database**, but we'll certainly not have time, unless you have the code ready somewhere

# The big picture, to be executed after ETH Denver 2021
1. Beyond the buidlathon, we follow our storyboard and continue adding features to Pepito
2. When we something showable that can simply be derived to make a taylored application for a specific NGO, I'd try and enroll a few small NGO's
3. If I succeed, I'll approach the Luxembourg government, as well as the German and French governments, and also the European Institutions for funding and operations
4. When we reach 10'000-50'000 persons in need with these small NGO's, I'll propose to UNICEF, Red Cross, WFP, Oxfam to join
